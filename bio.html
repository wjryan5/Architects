                    <a class="close">(CLICK TO CLOSE)<br>All of the original members of Architects grew up around Brighton, East Sussex and were very active within the local music scene prior to forming the band. Sam Carter, who was a drummer and studied drums at the Brighton Institute of Modern Music before joining the band, had performed in multiple local bands as a drummer and sometimes a singer; one of these bands had supported Enter Shikari in Brighton.

                        Architects was founded in 2004 by drummer Dan Searle and his twin brother, guitarist Tom Searle. The project was called "Counting the Days" until it blossomed into what is now known as "Architects" with original vocalist Matt Johnson, guitarist Tim Hillier-Brook and Tim Lucas on bass guitar. In 2006 the band's original bassist, Tim Lucas, decided to leave the band to pursue his academic career. He was replaced by Alex Dean. The band had traveled around the UK on many tours supporting a number of different bands (Beecher, Bring Me the Horizon) in support of their debut album Nightmares. Because of the age of the band members in the early years they had to book weeks of holiday off at college to do tours round the country.</a>

                        <a class="close">(CLICK TO CLOSE)<br>On 20 August 2016, founding guitarist and songwriter Tom Searle died at the age of 28, after living for three years with melanoma skin cancer. His condition was previously not made public, though he referenced it in the song "C.A.N.C.E.R" on Lost Forever // Lost Together. Searle was initially declared cancer free after a 2013 leg surgery, but the cancer returned. He was shown in the 'In Memoriam" segment at the 2017 BRIT awards, and the song "Paragon" on the Northlane album Mesmer was written in tribute to him.

                            Tom Searle's twin brother and bandmate, Dan, confirmed in a statement on the band's official Facebook page that their upcoming Australian tour, as well as their UK and Europe headline tour, would still be taking place as a tribute to his brother following his death. On the future of the band, Dan Searle wrote, "We want to carry on, that is important to say, and we will strive to do so, but we will not release any music unless we truly believe that it is something that Tom would have been proud of. Whether or not we can achieve that is something that we will have to discover in time"</a>
